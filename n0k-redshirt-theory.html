                            <p> Back when I was probably around the age of 10, I was given a game by a distant family member. They probably didn't know much about me, because Monster Trucks were the furthest thing from my mind. I ended up getting this incredibly generic shovelware game from them, entitled "Monster Truck Mayhem" for the Wii. I played the heck out of it, and loved it all the way. I admit, I still never developed a love for monster trucks, but that's beside the point. That game had a KICKASS soundt. For instance, there are some fringe IU fans who think Bob Knight should be the basketball and football coach. There’s a group of people that truly believe IU is losing to Ohio State, Michigan, and Penn State on purpose at the discretion of the Big Ten. And the craziest one I’ve heard was that Kevin Wilson was actually fired from the head coaching position because the school was tired of covering up his DUIs. Allegedly. He has played in two games this season, so he could only play in two more before losing his red shirt. With McCaffrey out indefinitely, why not save him for a potential injury to Shea (only being realistic) down the road? Does harbaugh have that much trust in Peters if we needed an actual spark in a game when we really needed. Bear with me, I'm writing this off the top of my head, so correct me if I go wrong somewhere. The 145th king is either a crackpot or a mind-controlled freak. How is he a crackpot genius? He had foresight. A sight which none of his predecessors ever had. He initiated a change that led to the Eldians to the current path. He saw, with his incredible big-lens, the world, in a way nobody had ever seen before. I ask you, why after 144 coordinate holders, did this guy decide. So, now that the Night Kings and the army of the dead are done with after three episodes, the focus is now down South with Cersei/The Golden Company/Euron. Though, I find this very unlikely that it will take three 80 minute episodes to deal with them considering Dany & co. have two dragons and a decent sized army (albeit weaker), as well as it seeming unlikely a bunch of mercenaries are the endgame villains. The episode times also support this, since we have around 236 minutes of showtime. The theory about Sandor Clegane being a Gravedigger on the Quiet Island was very popular long before the show basically made it canon. And a considerable portion of the fandom thought that this was a perfect ending for his character, that we should never see him again. Even now, with Sandor's return in the show, some readers hope that it's a show-only plotline and that in the books he will never be seen again. I disagree. I think that what we see in AFFC is not a fitting end for Sandor

One episode till the end and those two are the only characters worthy of an analysis(which is still one more than Season 3, heh). Lilly is a one note villain same as Carver from season 2(but lacking his random violence tendencies, trading them for calculated malice). There were opportunities to make her somewhat compelling but all of them got lost in episode 3 where it was shown just how sadistic and unrepentant she is.

New York Giants fans have gotten used to bickering back and forth with the rest of the country, debating the merits of Eli Manning. It's a battle that will rage on, long after we're all dead and buried in the Great Alien War of 2087. But right now, we may be coming to a temporary detente. Because right now? It seems obvious that Eli Manning's days as a viable NFL starter are coming to an end. The offensive line hasn't helped, to be sure, but he's in a noted statistical decline (and a decline.

About 3 redshirt members die at the beginning, so only those who remain really matter. They are around for the majority of the story, then most of them die in an epic shootout with bounty hunters, leaving only two for the conclusion. But how many should they be for the middle part?

Sorry this is a bit late, I was giving other posters time to post their reviews who were behind. # Too Long; Didn't Read A TL;DR version can be found in the comments. (https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/95py58/offseason_review_series_day_31_kansas_city_chiefs/e3uj6z3/) --- # Overview After the heart wrenching loss to the Titans in the Wild Card round at home, the Chiefs entered the offseason with many fans wanting changes. What transpired was an action packed offseason The last thing the internet needs is more draft grades from amateurs like myself, but I'm going to try and twist that trope slightly and rank every single pick. To do that, I'm going to award points based on two qualities: the value of the pick (relative to my draft board, not ESPN), and the fit of the player on his new team. NOTE: I'm going to rank the PICKS not the trades attached. It's not entirely fair, but it's easier. (1) C Robert Williams (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8l1. I would not recommend sports gambling unless you happen to have a load of disposal income. Hell, even then, I wouldn't recommend sports gambling. Unless you have some advanced analytical system or a Marty McFly sportsbook, it's a sucker's game and a surefire way to lose money over the long run. THAT SAID, it's still fun to talk about. And once and a while, try to take a chance on some good value picks. I'm going to suggest a few of those here, although be warned that a) gambling I love science fiction/hard sci-fi in general, but also am very interested psychology, and history- especially when the author is able to discuss the aspects of their society they’ve created in those terms (I.e. why might a given people be doing ____ in this situation? Discuss some precedents for and against/various views on how/why others might react to that, and so on- points for bringing the inevitable discussion of their relative technologies into this analysis (esp. when compared and contr. Rather try to read into smoke signals and media leaks and guess who will be taken, I'm going to list the players that I think should be taken. (1) Phoenix Suns If you believe rumors, the Phoenix Suns have zeroed in on local Arizona C DeAndre Ayton. And I have no problem with that. The # 2 overall prospect on my board, Ayton would fill a major area of need down low.

Here are my two cents, but please contribute your own below. ###### CLEVELAND BROWNS step one: fire Hue Jackson and get an adult instead When you're a young team like the Browns without a stable QB situation, you expect to lose games. In a sense, it's excusable. What is NOT excusable in my mind is a coach who refuses to accept any responsibility for that, and conti.
