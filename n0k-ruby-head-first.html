It all begin 3 months earlier when I kept begging my friend, we’ll call him the director, to get me some acid.

All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (The occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!) Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between midnight and noon PST. ## Ending. Throughout the hundreds of discussions I read online about Rubys character, there has always been two major points of view regarding her. One of them is that her character has next to no development or characterization, and though I can see where people are coming from, I don't particulary agree. The other one, and the one I'll be arguing in favor of, is that Ruby is hiding all her pain, using optimism as a facade to repress all her sadness and trauma, to the point that something will eventually. 
Greetings, Huntsmen, Huntresses, and gender neutral Hunters! Welcome to another week of writing prompts! If you are new here, this is a community-driven weekly event, and the purpose is primarily to generate creativity and have fun while doing so (whether you are a 100% real-meat person or not, we don't judge). Yes! We have no! Bananas Today! ____ ##What will be involved: Each week, three RWBY-related topics will be posted. Participants can write a short piece of fiction. The following recap is from F4WOnline.com. Here is the link to the recap. (https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-results/wwe-smackdown-live-results-gauntlet-match-276861) The show opened with a graphic for Pedro Morales, A recap of Raw opened the show, where Vince McMahon said that Becky isn't The Man, but he is. Vince suspended Becky, and announced Charlotte as taking Becky's place. Charlotte made her entrance to a massive amount of boos. She said main eventing WrestleMania was her destiny. Howdy, r/d100. I am planning a game wherein the players must seek out artifacts of a hedonistic and debaucherous nature for a powerful wizard seeking to throw an otherworldly party. Unfortunately, I am not at all smart, and thinking of several artifacts is more ashamedly complicated than I can manage alone. So here I ask for your ideas of items fit for the hardest of parties and artifacts one would expect to see in the possession of Sanguine or Slaanesh. 1. This white-gold chalice holds.
